For now, note that...

- References to `ts` files bundled.
- References to `js` files are kept in place.
- Meta `asset` tags are used for denoting static assets.
- Meta `asset-dir` tags are used for denoting directories of static assets.
- All locally referenced images, js files, stylesheets, font files, etc. are included in the bundle as assets.
